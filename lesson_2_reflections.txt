Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When you initialize a repository you tell git that this directory and all of the files inside
of it should be tracked. You should do this whenever you start a project that you want to
have version control support.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is different because it only contains the files that you add to it.
Where as the working directory contains all of the files inside. The value in the staging area
is that you are able to isolate only the files you wish to change. This gives you a clear cut
focus when working on a big project with many files.
